abstract="Assurance cases are a means to argue about the safety, security, etc., of software systems in critical domains. As systems evolve, their assurance cases can grow in complexity, making them difficult to maintain. In this paper, we present a tool MMINT-A that can, in the context of model-driven development, assess the impact of system changes on their assurance cases. To achieve this, MMINT-A implements an impact assessment algorithm from previous workÂ [7, 8] and incorporates a graphical assurance case editor, an annotation mechanism, and two summary tables for the assessment results. We demonstrate the usage of MMINT-A on a Power Sliding Door example from the automotive domain.",

abstract="From financial services platforms to social networks to vehicle control, software has come to mediate many activities of daily life. Governing bodies and standards organizations have responded to this trend by creating regulations and standards to address issues such as safety, security and privacy. In this environment, the compliance of software development to standards and regulations has emerged as a key requirement. Compliance claims and arguments are often captured in assurance cases, with linked evidence of compliance. Evidence can come from testcases, verification proofs, human judgment, or a combination of these. That is, experts try to build (safety-critical) systems carefully according to well justified methods and articulate these justifications in an assurance case that is ultimately judged by a human. Yet software is deeply rooted in uncertainty; most complex open-world functionality (e.g., perception of the state of the world by a self-driving vehicle), is either not completely specifiable or it is not cost-effective to do so; software systems are often to be placed into uncertain environments, and there can be uncertainties that need to be We argue that the role of assurance cases is to be the grand unifier for software development, focusing on capturing and managing uncertainty. We discuss three approaches for arguing about safety and security of software under uncertainty, in the absence of fully sound and complete methods: assurance argument rigor, semantic evidence composition and applicability to new kinds of systems, specifically those relying on ML.",

abstract="Perception is a safety-critical function of autonomous vehicles and machine learning (ML) plays a key role in its implementation. This position paper identifies (1) perceptual uncertainty as a performance measure used to define safety requirements and (2) its influence factors when using supervised ML. This work is a first step towards a framework for measuring and controling the effects of these factors and supplying evidence to support claims about perceptual uncertainty.",

abstract="Incident Management is the process through which IT support organizations manage to restore normal service operation after a service disruption. The complexity of IT support organizations makes it extremely hard to understand the impact of organizational, structural and behavioral components on the performance of the currently adopted incident management strategy and, consequently, which actions could improve it. This paper presents SYMIAN, a decision support tool for the improvement of incident management performance. SYMIAN is a discrete event simulator that permits to test possible corrective measures for the IT support organization before the expensive actual implementation. SYMIAN models the IT support organization as a queuing system, considering both the time spent by operators working on incidents and the time spent when waiting for operator's availability. Experimental results show the SYMIAN effectiveness in the performance analysis and optimization of the incident resolution time for a fictitious organization designed according to real-life experiences.",
